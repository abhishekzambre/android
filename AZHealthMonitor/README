App Name : AZ Health Monitor

Description :
App generates data based on values recorded by light sensor. Instead of using random numbers, I have initialized SensorManager object, and attached listener to it. It will record light intensity in the room and will provide corresponding data to GraphView object.

Please note, in order to test the app, please run it on external device (instead of emulator), and hover your hand over the screen (where usually light sensor is located). It will show the change in values, and will display graph accordingly.

Features :
1. Used light sensor to generate data.
2. Auto-rotate (Portrait + Landscape) view supported.
3. Input validation.
4. About page added using Menu.

Tested on : Google Nexus 5X, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Motorola Moto G4, Samsung Galaxy Note 2.

Please contact in case any issues/bugs.
